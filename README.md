Project Title: Gym Scheduler

Goal: To develop a web application that allows gym members to schedule workouts at a gym with limited space. The application should automate as much of the scheduling process as possible, but should also allow administrators to manually intervene when necessary.

Requirements:

    User Registration and Authentication: Users should be able to register for an account, log in, and log out. The user's account should store their name, email, and password for authentication.

    User Roles: There should be two types of users: regular users and administrators. Administrators should have the ability to manually intervene in the scheduling process.

    Membership Types: Users can have one of two types of memberships: regular or premium. The type of membership affects the number of available slots for booking (6 slots per hour for regular members, 3 slots per hour for premium members).

    Booking System: Users should be able to request a time slot for a workout. The system should check whether a slot is available before confirming the booking. If a slot is not available, the system should notify the user.

    Admin Intervention: Administrators should be able to manually intervene in the scheduling process. This could involve modifying or cancelling bookings.

    Operation Hours and Days: The gym operates for 8 hours a day, 6 days a week. The booking system should take this into account and only allow bookings during operation hours and days.

    Automated Scheduling: The main goal of the application is to automate as much of the scheduling process as possible. This could involve automatically deleting past bookings at the end of the day or implementing other automated processes as necessary.

    Technology Stack: The application should be built using Python, leveraging Django as the primary web framework. Other technologies (e.g., frontend frameworks, databases) can be used as needed.

1. After initializing the directories and including them in INSTALLED_APPS as described above, you can proceed with the following steps:

    Design Database Models: In each app's models.py file, you would define the data models that you need. For instance, in the users app, you might have a User model with fields for the user's name, email, password, role, and membership type. Django's User model already includes fields for email, password, and a few other fields you might find useful, so you might want to extend Django's User model rather than creating your own from scratch.

    Create and Apply Migrations: After defining your models, you'll need to create and apply database migrations. Migrations are Django's way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into the database schema. Run python manage.py makemigrations app_name to create migrations for each app. Then, run python manage.py migrate to apply the migrations and create the database tables.

    Define Views: Views are Python functions that take a web request and return a web response. This response can be the HTML contents of a webpage, a redirect, a 404 error, an XML document, an image, or anything else. You would define these views in each app's views.py file.

    Configure URLs: You will need to set up URL routing for each app by creating a urls.py file in each app directory. Each URL will be associated with a specific view. You will also need to include these URLs in the project's main urls.py file.

    Create Templates: If your views are returning HTML, you will likely want to create templates to make generating these HTML files easier. Templates are stored in a templates directory in each app directory.

    Admin Interface: Django provides a built-in admin interface that you can use for managing the data in your apps. You would register your models in each app's admin.py file to make them available in the admin interface.

    User Authentication: Django comes with a built-in user authentication system that handles user registration, login, and logout.

    Static and Media Files: If your app has static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images), create a static directory in each app. For user uploaded files, create a media directory in your project.

    Testing: Django provides a built-in testing framework that you can use to write unit tests for your views, models, etc.

    Deployment: Once you've built your app, you'll want to deploy it to a server so that it's accessible on the internet.

Remember, Django follows the DRY principle - Don't Repeat Yourself. Django's philosophy is to try to automate as much as possible and to reuse existing components wherever possible. So, always look for built-in Django features or third-party packages that can help you achieve your goals before trying to build something from scratch.
